# Realtime_Skip_Dpcrn_Tflite_Denoise
This project is C++ (Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2019) port of dpcrn_tflite denoise.
I've included dependencies for tflite, fft in Windows.
You can test project using single channel 16Khz wav files.

# USAGE
Modify the paths to int_file and out_file for the Main function.

# TIPS
I've tested project on Windows 10 (i5-8265U) environment and got realtime performance.
